$\text{Hybridoma technology for monoclonal antibody production}$

1. **Immunization:** the antigen is first injected into a mouse to provoke an immune response.
2. **B cell harvest:** the spleen is harvested because it harbors many activated B cells.
3. **Cell fusion:** the spleen cells are short-lived in culture, so they are fused to immortal myeloma cells.
4. **Hybridoma cell growth:** the hybridoma cells are cultured and isolated so each hybrid is separate from the other.
5. **Screening:** each hybrid clone can then be screened for the best antibody to the target protein.

- It includes:
  - The creation and use of therapeutic stem cells to repair a problem area in our body.
  - Tissue engineering
  - Production of artificial organs.
- The iPSCs can be genetically engineered before differentiation and ransplanting for medical purpose.

##### $\text{somatic cell nuclear transfer and reproductive cloning}$

- Reproductive cloning is defined as the deliberate production of genetically identical individuals.
- Each newly produced individual is a clone of the original.
- Cells from two clones have the same DNA and the same genes in their nuclei.
- There are two methods used for reproductive cloning:
  - somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) 体细胞核移植
  - embryo splitting/artificial embryo twinning 胚胎分裂

$\text{somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)}$

- Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) involves the culture of donor somatic cells and oocytes, transplantation of donor cell nuclei into enucleated oocytes, activation of reconstructed embryos, and transfer of cloned embryos into surrogates (代孕者).
- Successful cloning of more than 20 mammalian species has been reported using SCNT technology.
- In addition to cloning new organisms (reproductive cloning), SCNT can be used to clone new stem cells (therapeutic cloning)

##### $\text{Cell reprogramming and therapeutic cloning}$

- Therapeutic cloning refers to the use of SCNT to reprogram somatic cells into undifferentiated cells (embryonic stem cells) for different therapeutic purposes.
- The difference between reproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning:

  - therapeutic cloning aims to clone new stem cells for differentiation and disease treatment

### $$\text{Module 9}$$

#### $$\text{Transgenic animals and plants}$$

##### $\text{Trangene}$

- Transgenesis consists of introducing an exogenous (外源的)DNA sequence into the genome of an organism, which then becomes present in most cells and is transmitted to progeny (后代).
- Transgenesis is capable of expressing foreign gene in an organism or edit the genome of an organism.

$
\\
\,
\\
$

- Transgenic technology involves introducing exogenous DNA into the genome of an organism.
- Most of transgenic animals produced so far are mice. It was then followed by rabbits, pigs, sheep, chicken, fish and cattle, or even primates.
- There are mainly 3 transgenic strategies:
  - retrovirus mediated gene transfer
  - DNA microinjection (显微注射)
  - Embryonic stem cell method, which is an approach that is routinely used to achieve gene-targeted (基因靶向) transgene

##### $\text{Embryonic stem cell method}$

This method refers to the introduction of foreign genes into fertilized eggs or embryonic stem cells, through random recombination to insert foreign genes into the chromosomal DNA of cells, and then implant fertilized eggs or embryonic stem cells into the uterus of the recipient animal, so that the foreign genes can be inherited to offspring with cell division.

**Key steps:**

1. Obtain embryonic stem cells from donor blastocysts
1. Construction of transgene expression vectors
1. Introduction of exogenous genes into ES cells
1. Modified ES cells into blastocysts (囊胚)
1. Implant the blastocyst to surrogate animal
1. Acquisition and identification of transgenic animals
1. Establishment of transgenic animal strains

##### $\text{Definition of gene targeting}$

- Gene targeting is the process of altering a specific sequence or gene at its location in a genome.
- Gene targeting is made possible through homologous recombination (HR, 同源重组) which involves the exchange of nucleotides between two similar or identical DNA sequences.
- Gene targeting enables the tremendous ability of modifying essentially any endogenous gene at will in a site-specific (位点特异) manner and even in a single nucleotide accuracy.
- Potential modifications include deletion, insertion or replacement of endogenous sequence with alternative sequences.

##### $\text{Principle of knockout and knock-in techniques}$

$\text{Gene Knockout(KO):}$

- Gene knockout (KO) is a genetic engineering method to make genes inoperative or deleted from the organism’s genome.
- Gene knockout uses stem cell method to generate breeding animals.
- The introduced exogenous DNA can homologously recombinant with chromosomal DNA in the same sequence region, therefore destroying endogenous genes in ES cells at a fixed site.
- Gene knockout can result in a complete loss of function of a gene and allows scientists to understand the importance of a gene by functional analysis.
- Gene knockout is also a type of gene targeting technology.

$\text{Gene Knockin(KI):}$

- Gene knockin (KI) is a genetic engineering method to make insertion, deletion and substitution of DNA sequences within the organism’s genome.
- Gene knockin uses stem cell method to generate breeding animals.
- The introduced exogenous DNA can homologously
recombinant with chromosomal DNA in the same sequence region, therefore replacing endogenous genes in ES cells at a fixed site.
- Gene knockout can result in a complete loss of function of a gene and allows scientists to understand the importance of a gene by functional analysis.
- Gene knockin is also a type of gene targeting technology.

##### $\text{Application of transgenic animals and plants}$

**$\text{Animal:}$**

1.**Biomedical Research:** Transgenic animals are used to study gene function, disease mechanisms, and drug development. For instance, mouse models can mimic human diseases to test new treatments.
2.**Pharmaceutical Production:** Some transgenic animals produce proteins or antibodies that can be harvested for therapeutic use. For example, goats and cows have been engineered to produce proteins for drugs like antithrombin (抗凝血酶). **–Bioreactor (生物反应器)**.

```e.g.:mammary gland bioreactor (乳腺生物反应器) of transgenic can be used for production of human serum albumin (has, 人血清白蛋白), fibrinogen (hFIB,纤维蛋白原), human protein c (hPC), human blood clotting factor VIII (HF-VIII,人凝血因子)and human blood clotting factor (hF-IX), etc.```

3.**Agriculture:** Transgenic animals can be modified for traits like disease resistance, improved growth rates, or enhanced nutritional content. For instance, pigs have been genetically engineered to be more resistant to certain diseases.
4.**Tissue and Organ Transplantation:** Researchers are exploring transgenic pigs as potential organ donors for humans, aiming to reduce the risk of rejection **- Xenotransplantation (异种移植)**.
5.**Environmental Research:** Transgenic animals can help in studying environmental effects on ecosystems or in bioremediation processes.
6.**Food Production:** Genetic modifications can lead to improved traits in livestock, such as faster growth or higher quality meat and milk.

**$\text{Plants:}$**

1. Resistance to biotic and abiotic stress: Biotic stress is imposed on plants as a result of the action of living beings such as viruses, bacteria, pests and pathogens. Abiotic stress comes from changes in the environment, such as soil composition, humidity, water level, and temperature.
2. Increased nutritional value: Biofortification (生物强化) is the process of increasing the nutritional value of a crop. Malnutrition is a common problem in developing countries. As a solution, plants are engineered to produce crops of better nutritional value.
3. Factories for production of recombinant proteins: Recombinant human proteins have been produced using plant system.
